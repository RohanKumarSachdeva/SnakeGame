NOTES:

# Initializing and exiting pygame:
 - pygame.init(), the very first method to initialize pygame.
 - On an event.type == pygame.QUIT, we call pygame.quit() to terminate pygame.

# Frame Rate and clock tick function:
 - The process runs an infinite while loop whenever it gets scheduled by CPU.
 - This will increase the CPU utilisation
 - To avoid this we make the game run consistently by restrict its frame rate.
 - clock.tick(60), will make the loop run only 60 times per second.

# Types of surfaces in PyGame module:
1) Display Surface  
  - It's the canvas on which the entire game is drawn on.
  - There is only one display surface in the entire window.
  - This surface is displayed by default.

2) Surface
  - A layer that can display graphics.
  - There can be multiple surfaces.
  - These are not displayed by default.
  - Surface can be created by: importing image, writing text or an empty space.
    pygame.Surface((100, 200))
  - After creating they need to be put on "Display Surface". We use blit(block image
    transfer) game_screen.blit(test_surface, (200, 250)); takes name and position where
    you want this test surface to be drawn on.

# Filling background color
  - game_screen.fill(pygame.Color('green')), we can also use game_screen.fill((r,g,b)) RGB
    tuple.
  - Value of R,G,B range from 0-255.
