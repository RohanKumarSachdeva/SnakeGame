NOTES:

# Frame Rate and clock tick function:
 - The process runs an infinite while loop whenever it gets scheduled by CPU.
 - This will increase the CPU utilisation
 - To avoid this we make the game run consistently by restrict its frame rate.
 - clock.tick(60), will make the loop run only 60 times per second.
